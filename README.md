# DESCRIPTION:
Colors items in STEP files having their colors previously defined as RGB
values of: '1' for any/all of the COLOUR_RGB strings.
All of the included 'Stock' STEP files already contain these declarations.

# INSTALLING:
**Helpful Info Prior to Installation**
The App contains a Selection of Stock-Parts provided for Ease-Of-Use.
To be able to select them from the Drop-Down 'Part Selector', they MUST be
located in the SAME FOLDER as the App.
However, if you prefer a different location, that's O.K., but you will NOT
be able to Select them from the Drop-Down (more info in 'Using' Section).
Install the App (and files) - it is a 'Stand-Alone' application that can also
be run from a Kicad Plugin (also provided for download).
The Plugin will need EDITing of the App file location...

# USING:
Select a Part, select desired Colors, Save New Step.
If you installed into location without also installing the Parts into the same
location, simply Select the 'Select Part' in Drop-Down, you will be Prompted
to locate a STEP file.
Note: Selecting 'Select Part' is a User's tool for changing Colors on STEP files
for testing, including the many STEP files provided by Kicad and elsewhere.
Thus, use with Caution as you many corrupt a good STEP file. Make a Backup!
Also, you can have Both the included Parts and also Select Part from other
other locations.
Note: All files are Saved to the App's location.

# TIP's:

advantage of Kicad' ability to setup multiple 3D-Models (STEP files) for
a Footprint and how to Update PCB with/without affecting particular/all
Footprints
